# Machine Learning

This repository aims to explore Machine learning concepts and algorithms.

Machine learning enables a machine to automatically learn from data, improve performance from experiences, and predict things without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel). It is a subset of artificial intelligence that is mainly concerned with the development of algorithms which allow a computer to learn from the data and past experiences on their own. 

# Workflow:
-	Data Collection:
> Various file sources: databases, internet, mobile service
> High data, high accuracy and generalization
> Identify data source --> collect data --> integrate

-	Data preparation:
> Data exploration: understand characteristics, format, correlation, general trends and outliers
> Convert data in useable format
> Data pre-processing

-	Data wrangling:
> Cleaning the data
> Selecting the variable to use
> Converting it into a proper format
> Missing values, duplicate data, invalid data, noise checked and removed

-	Analyse data:
> Apply the machine learning algorithms of regression, classification and clustering
> Build a predictive model

-	Train model:
> Training a model to understand patterns. 

-	Test model:
> Test model, check accuracy of model

-	Deployment:
> Deploy model in real world
